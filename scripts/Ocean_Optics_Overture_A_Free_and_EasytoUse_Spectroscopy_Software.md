Overture is compatible with most Ocean Optics spectrometers and works on 32-/64-bit Windows systems. You can control the integration time and other spectrometer parameters through an user-friendly interface with icons and setup wizards. You can also manipulate how data is displayed using tools such as smoothing, snapshot and zoom, and compare two graphs simultaneously. Moreover, Overture has a concentration wizard that guides you through the process of measuring solutions absorbance at different concentrations, plotting a calibration curve and applying Beer-Lambert law to determine unknown concentrations.
 
Overture comes standard with most Ocean Optics spectrometer purchases. If you already own an Ocean Optics spectrometer, you can download a free copy of Overture from their website[^1^] [^2^]. Overture is a great way to get started with spectroscopy and explore the possibilities of your Ocean Optics spectrometer.
  
What is spectroscopy and why is it useful? Spectroscopy is the study of how light interacts with matter. By measuring the spectrum of light emitted or absorbed by a sample, we can learn about its chemical composition, physical properties and molecular structure. Spectroscopy has many applications in science, industry and medicine, such as identifying substances, measuring concentrations, detecting pollutants, diagnosing diseases and analyzing materials.
 
How does an Ocean Optics spectrometer work? An Ocean Optics spectrometer is a device that splits light into its component wavelengths and measures the intensity of each wavelength. The spectrometer consists of three main components: a light source, a sample holder and a detector. The light source emits light that passes through or reflects from the sample. The sample holder holds the sample in place and may have a filter or a lens to modify the light. The detector captures the light and converts it into an electrical signal that can be processed by a computer.
 
What are the advantages of using an Ocean Optics spectrometer? Ocean Optics spectrometers are compact, portable and versatile. They can be used for a wide range of applications and measurements, such as UV-Vis-NIR spectroscopy, fluorescence spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy and reflectance spectroscopy. They can also be customized and integrated with other devices and accessories to suit your specific needs. Ocean Optics spectrometers are easy to use and affordable, making them ideal for both beginners and experts in spectroscopy.
