However, Knoll Unmult is not compatible with the latest versions of After Effects CC, and you may encounter errors or crashes when trying to use it. In this article, we will show you how to fix this issue and use Knoll Unmult plugin for After Effects CC without any problems.
 
## Step 1: Download and Install Knoll Unmult
 
The first step is to download and install Knoll Unmult plugin from the official website of Red Giant, the company that developed it. You can find the download link here: [https://www.redgiant.com/products/knoll-unmult-free/](https://www.redgiant.com/products/knoll-unmult-free/)
 
Once you have downloaded the zip file, extract it and copy the KnollUnmult.aex file to the following folder: C:\Program Files\Adobe\Adobe After Effects CC\Support Files\Plug-ins\Effects
 
If you have a different version of After Effects CC, you may need to adjust the folder path accordingly.
 
## Step 2: Apply Knoll Unmult to Your Layer
 
Now that you have installed Knoll Unmult plugin, you can use it on any layer that has bright pixels on a black background. For example, you can use it on a stock footage of fire or smoke, or on a text layer with a glow effect.
 
To apply Knoll Unmult to your layer, simply select it in the timeline and go to Effect > Red Giant > Knoll Unmult. You will see a new effect panel in the Effect Controls window. Here you can adjust the settings of Knoll Unmult, such as Threshold, Invert Alpha, and Color Correction.
 
The Threshold parameter determines how bright a pixel has to be to become transparent. A lower value will make more pixels transparent, while a higher value will make fewer pixels transparent. You can adjust this parameter until you get the desired result.
 
The Invert Alpha parameter reverses the alpha channel of the layer. This can be useful if you want to create a matte from a layer that has dark pixels on a white background instead of bright pixels on a black background.
 
The Color Correction parameter allows you to change the hue, saturation, and brightness of the layer. This can help you match the color of the layer with the rest of your composition.
 
## Step 3: Enjoy Your Composite
 
Once you have applied Knoll Unmult to your layer, you can use it as a normal layer in your composition. You can blend it with other layers, add effects, masks, or animations to it. You can also duplicate it or pre-compose it if you need to.
 
Knoll Unmult is a simple but powerful plugin that can enhance your compositing workflow in After Effects CC. By using it, you can create alpha channels from any layer that has bright pixels on a black background, without having to use luma keying or rotoscoping techniques.
